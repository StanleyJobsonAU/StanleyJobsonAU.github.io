			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>I discovered a remote code execution vulnerability within the Web Portal of the <b>TP-Link Archer VR1600V</b> router.<br> This vulnerability can be exploited via a single HTTP request and allows an attacker with administrative access to the <br>web portal to gain administrative access to the underlying operating system. It is important to note that the <br>vulnerability requires local network access and cannot be exploited over the internet. The impacts of this <br>vulnerability are severe and wide-ranging. An attacker could modify the contents of the device and cause a loss of <br>availability to the device by deliberately modifying certain data within the device which would cause a boot failure on <br>the device. Furthermore, the confidentiality of the binaries and firmware could be compromised, as they would now be <br>accessible to the attacker. This would also allow an attacker to modify running configurations outside the parameters <br>of the vendor, potentially causing additional security issues. I followed responsible disclosure guidelines and <br>coordinated with the vendor to ensure that the vulnerability is patched in a timely and secure manner. </p>

			<h2>Technical Details</h2>
			<p>The vulnerability affects devices with a firmware version of <b><= 0.1.0 0.9.1 v5006.0 Build 220518 Rel.32480n</b>. 
				<br>The root cause of the issue is that a specific variable called <b>X_TP_IfName</b> that is passed to the web server <br>in a POST request during certain operations within the web portal is passed directly into an Operating System command. 
				<br><br>
				<br>The issue occurs because the user can supply arbitrary values within this variable including shell metacharacters <br>which can be used to 'break out' of the intended command and then run additional commands. While there was some <br>sanitization performed on this parameter (it was restricted to 15 characters which is not a lot of room for command <br>injection). A suitable bypass was eventually found which enabled unlimited code execution on the device.
				<br><br>
				<br>As a simple example, consider the following scenario: There exists a service within a web page which checks if <br>another host is online. It may utilize the built-in "Ping" command to do this. The service will take a variable <br>called "host" from the user and then construct the following operating system command: ping <host> -c 4 returning <br>the result to the end user. Secondly, there exists methods to "stack" commands. For Linux operating systems, the ';<br>' character can be used to append a command (e.g. ping 127.0.0.1; echo a) which will first execute the ping, then <br>execute the echo command. Referring back to our example, the service will work if the user supplies the expected <br>value (e.g. a website name or an IP address). However, if the user supplies the character to stack a command, <br>followed by another arbitrary command, they can get underlying code execution on the system even though it was not <br>intended.
				<br><br>
				<br>So a vector is in hand to achieve command execution, however it is extremely limited. 15 characters is not enough <br>to build a traditional reverse shell. There are several possible options. One option is to use the vulnerability <br>repeatedly to build a script character by character, make the script executable with the chmod command and then <br>execute it directly via the vulnerability. This was not possible as the underlying operating system was a Linux <br>MIPS operating System which did not include the "print" command. The print command is a prerequisite for this sort <br>of method because it does not print a trailing new-line character which is a must for building the script character <br>by character. Trying to do this using the available 'echo' command resulted in new-lines being inserted into the <br>script on each execution rendering it useless. Another method to consider was using an available binary to expose <br>pseudo operating system access or shell access. Two prerequisites are needed for this a) the ability to use the <br>binary to create a shell and b) the ability for the binary to be remotely exposed by binding to the local network <br>interface (because we don't already have local shell access).
				<br><br>
				<br>After searching, telnetd was identified as a candidate where we can expose a shell even with the character <br>restrictions. There is a feature of telnetd where you can specify what program to run on the telnet daemon using <br>the "-L" flag. By default this is /bin/logon. However we can specify an arbitrary program, including the shell <br>binary (sh) which would provide a TTY interface. This meets our first prerequisite. The telnet daemon is a well <br>known program for remotely interacting with systems. It by default binds to Port 23 on the local network. A port <br>can also be specified with the "-p" parameter, however there is not enough room for this. Therefore we are limited <br>to the default Port of 23. However this satisfies condition two, that the binary be able to be remotely exposed. We <br>can therefore specify the 'sh' shell to be tied to the telnet daemon and exposed via Port 23 with the following <br>command: 'telnetd -l sh'. Including the two stack command characters, this totals exactly 15 characters. Just <br>enough to fit into the injection point. As the web server is running as admin, the shell exposed via the interface <br>is admin too. This gives us total remote access to the device.
				<br><br>
				<br>That being said, it is important to note that the web portal is not exposed remotely, and this is a completely <br>local attack vector which cannot be exploited via the internet. As a result, an attacker must have local network <br>access to the device and given we are required to access the administrator portal, must have administrative access <br>as well. This is typically a default set of credentials but can be configured by the user.</p>
